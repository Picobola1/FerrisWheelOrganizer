# A Ferris Wheel That Organizes
P.S This is a project that you randomly think would be funny but end actully makeing it.

This project is a ferris wheel that you can put screws and other small items in, so when you push a button, it rotates the wheel one seat(holder thingy) so you can grab whatever you need then go to the next seat.

I made this project beause i though it would be funny and a cool desktoy

the hardest part was defenitly modeleing beacuse i am pretty new to onshape and i have never built somehting so big with it before. 

I learned that i really enjoy listing to music while working on it and that i should plan and save files a lot more.

# To build it

24x M3x12 screws (i get mine from this kit [Here](https://www.amazon.com/HanTof-Phillips-Assortment-Eletronic-Stainless/dp/B0C4T1ZDYL) i also use this screw kit for other projects tpp :) )

1x 28BYJ-48 DC Stepper Motor 

1x ULN2003 Driver Test Module Board (you can get both [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Aoicrie-28BYJ-48-Stepper-ULN2003-Arduino/dp/B07Z4BCY34/ref=sr_1_18?crid=30050OUVGY3IK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4H5mpY-xIVvTQ6Eu0ElQQyx78D2V2-c2F2viQ88cHiyxLSFPU7p_H6jLMM5rM2Pp9f4mAYkoUhALU2quD43HG_aMONg68MmZ2DaTBeR3hcnlQBhZBcOzhS3Y3RNNsGsDzrrSdXtXVqw4l3c2jbkXNIHOEM2RvwsW0aHa2bCH63sEDpWlfRnqr4-50PPtt0l0thLjaa-dxNKJ7Ksv6xj-bLVRP6vb6Vl8F-y-Su2ypJs.hxkWC0xT_ZFts2pBB3f8EnZUKG_TjAzSC9bmYVCKEYs&dib_tag=se&keywords=unipolar+stepper+motor&qid=1753672978&sprefix=stepper+motor+uni%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-18))

1x Pin Header 1x5 (for pcb)

1x Pin Header 1x2 (for pcb)

breadboard and wires for testing the hardware before using the grb to manufacutre the pcb.



All of the parts 3d printed or someother way like resin (20% percent infill is fine but it doesnt really matter)
1x of everything execpt for 3x buttons and however many cargo/ holder you want (max is 8)

# Instructions

Once you have all of the parts, go ahead and use this schematic to help you wire it with a breadboard or if your brave just order the pcb

# Step 1

lay the base on its side and put the main wheel through the hole on the base with the middle part holding the 2 wheels together then slide in the cargo/holder that you want and screw them in with the M3 12mm screws.

# Step 2 

put the second base on top of step 1 so it aligns with the screw holes and screw it in with the M3 12mm screws.

# Step 3 

You have now finsihed the Ferris Wheel now time for the controller. Note this does have to be close to the ferris wheel unless your stepper motor has really long wires.

First insert the pcb into the box and wire the stuff from the pcb up (At the bottem) then hot glue or glue the 3 buttons onto the buttons and put the top on, use M3 12mm screws.

# Step 4 

Now just upload the code and plugin the power :) have fun.


# PCB guide 

to plug every thing in the 2 pins are for power and gnd , the 5 pins are for the motor driver 4 input pins, and glue the buttons onto the push buttons and you are all set
