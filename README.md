# A Ferris Wheel That Organizes
P.S This is a project that you randomly think would be funny but end actully makeing it.

This project is a ferris wheel that you can put screws and other small items in, so when you push a button, it rotates the wheel one seat(holder thingy) so you can grab whatever you need then go to the next seat.

# To build it

24x M3x12 screws (i get mine from this kit [Here](https://www.amazon.com/HanTof-Phillips-Assortment-Eletronic-Stainless/dp/B0C4T1ZDYL) i also use this screw kit for other projects tpp :) )

1x 28BYJ-48 DC Stepper Motor 

1x ULN2003 Driver Test Module Board (you can get both [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Aoicrie-28BYJ-48-Stepper-ULN2003-Arduino/dp/B07Z4BCY34/ref=sr_1_18?crid=30050OUVGY3IK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4H5mpY-xIVvTQ6Eu0ElQQyx78D2V2-c2F2viQ88cHiyxLSFPU7p_H6jLMM5rM2Pp9f4mAYkoUhALU2quD43HG_aMONg68MmZ2DaTBeR3hcnlQBhZBcOzhS3Y3RNNsGsDzrrSdXtXVqw4l3c2jbkXNIHOEM2RvwsW0aHa2bCH63sEDpWlfRnqr4-50PPtt0l0thLjaa-dxNKJ7Ksv6xj-bLVRP6vb6Vl8F-y-Su2ypJs.hxkWC0xT_ZFts2pBB3f8EnZUKG_TjAzSC9bmYVCKEYs&dib_tag=se&keywords=unipolar+stepper+motor&qid=1753672978&sprefix=stepper+motor+uni%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-18))

ALSO

breadboard and wires for testing the hardware before using the grb to manufacutre the pcb.

All of the parts 3d printed or someother way like resin (20% percent infill is fine but it doesnt really matter)

#Instructions

Once you have all of the parts, go ahead and use this schematic to help you wire it with a breadboard
