# A Ferris Wheel That Organizes
P.S This is a project that you randomly think would be funny but end actully makeing it.

This project is a ferris wheel that you can put screws and other small items in, so when you push a button, it rotates the wheel one seat(holder thingy) so you can grab whatever you need then go to the next seat.

# To build it

3d print all the ferris wheel parts

24x M3x12 screws

The pcb or breadboard + all the hardware

 - then you just screw everything together. (i dont have the physical parts right now to build it so i cant really demonstrate.)
