# A Ferris Wheel That Organizes
P.S This is a project that you randomly think would be funny but end actully makeing it.

This project is a ferris wheel that you can put screws and other small items in, so when you push a button, it rotates the wheel one seat(holder thingy) so you can grab whatever you need then go to the next seat.
